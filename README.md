# h-nav-bar
My take on a fixed, horizontal nav bar.
All code is HTML / CSS (It's fairly simple work, I'm just losing my mind.)

I tried to leave some comments to make sense of the work but it's nearly 12PM and I am very tired.

Here's some gifs of the elements I ike the most.

I hope you have a lovely day.
